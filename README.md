# sdr (Spring Data Rest)


It'a project to show how Spring Data Rest work.


# part1 => index.html

Based on [accessing-data-rest](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/) , I add index.html with jquery to request the resources and add resource in order to show basic CRUD with GET , POST , PUT , PATCH , DELETE .


My note : [link](http://jackmew.github.io/2014/09/12/20140912/)

# part2 => OneToMany , ManyToOne


# part3 => paging  , sort
